http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0006306	TUBO			cultured cell		"TUBO cells are a cloned line established in vitro from a BALB-neuT mouse mammary carcinoma. They display membrane class I H-2dMHC glycoproteins and rp185neu proteins. In BALB/c mice, r-p185 is a xenogeneic Ag that differs from mouse rp185 in <6% of the amino residues. Despite these differences, a challenge of 1 x 105 TUBO cells grew progressively in all BALB/c mice and gave rise to lobular carcinomas histologically similar to those that appear in BALB-neuT-transgenic mice. The reactive cell infiltrate associated with TUBO cell growth was marginal. No anti-TUBO cell CTL, nor IFN-gama, nor GM-CSF release were found when Spc from BALB/c mice bearing 3- or 10-mm mean TUBO tumors were tested immediately or after 6 days in in vitro restimulation with TUBO cells. Moreover, no anti-rp185 Ab were detected in the sera of tumor bearing mice. Despite their high membrane expression of the xenogeneic rp185, growing TUBO cells appear to trigger a marginal or no immune reaction in BALB/c mice."
